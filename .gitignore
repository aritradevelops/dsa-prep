# Go module cache

# Dependencies downloaded by Go modules
# This is typically handled by `go mod vendor` or `go mod download`
# and should generally be committed if using vendoring.
# However, if you are not vendoring and want to ignore the downloaded modules,
# you might include these:
# pkg/mod/

# Build outputs
# Executables compiled by `go build`
# You might want to ignore specific executable names if they are not meant for distribution
# For example, if your main executable is named `my-app`:
# my-app
# my-app.exe
